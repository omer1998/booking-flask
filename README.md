# booking-flask
booking system project is intended to provide easy solution for both doctors and patient:
for patient:
schedual appointment easily (i we need taxi we choose careem or baly, if we need food we choose talabat, why shouldn't we provide easy solution to facilitate making appointment for patient)
look for nearby doctors
choose their doctor who best serve them (according to the doctor's speciality, reviews, and overall doctor's experience)
to hopefully decrease the waiting time (as for each patient there must be a time slot booked for them)

for doctor:
easy to manage their patient 
to know their patient well by having access to their patients' info (if we know the patient well we have a better chance to serve them well)
to provide stats for doctors about their clinic's progress across months or year in order to enhance thier progress

booking database was done using postgresql as db management system 
i choose it because it has multiple extra features including custom data types, array and more important has location extension Postgis (to provide a professional way in saving patient and doctors location and hopefully make the patient able to know the nearest doctor for them)

i choose flask because:
* it is simple framework, can be extended well to add any feature easily
* it is based on my knowledge in cs50 course
* it is python --> easy, powerful accomplish task quickly
